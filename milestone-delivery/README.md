## :mailbox: Milestone Delivery Process

The milestone delivery process is part of the [General Grant Program](../README.md). You can find the application process [here](../README.md#process).  

:warning: Before you submit a milestone, make sure it complies with milestone delivrables described in the initial pull request.

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/vechain/Grants-Program/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/fork) this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the application.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md`](deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md)). Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the file `project_name-milestone_number.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone including a **link to the pull request** of your application.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request.
2. **Milestone Review:**
   1. [Evaluators](.../Grant-program#vechain-grant-evaluators) can (and usually do) issue comments and request changes on the pull request. Their feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
   2. Grants Evaluators will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
3. **Milestone Payment:**
   1. The [Operation Team](.../Grant-program#vechain-operation-team) receives a notification once the delivery is accepted.
   2. Payment is made to the ERC 20 address specified in the initial application. The exchange rate for VET/BTC depends on the time of payment.

Grant applications can be amended at any time. However, this _necessitates a reevaluation by the committee_. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.
